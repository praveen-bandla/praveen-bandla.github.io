Origami, from *ori* meaning "folding" and *kami* meaning "paper", is the traditional Japanese art or technique of folding paper into a variety of decorative or representational forms.

I particularly enjoy single-sheet animal designs, but have also dabbled in modular origami. I like experimenting with papers of different sizes - recently I have been experimenting with jumbo paper!

Much of work is emulating models sketched by Robert J. Lang, Meenakshi Mukerji, and Tomoko Fuse. Recently, I started reading about the mathematics of origami - the theory that goes into creating designs! It is a highly technical field that involves a complex algorithm, engineering, and even a unique set of axioms called the Huzita-Hatori axioms. Robert Lang is particulatly inspring - a physicist and mathematician by trade, with a speciality in semiconductor lasers. 20 years ago, he left the industry to be a full-time origami artist and consultant. His theories of origami have been usd to design folding patterns for a German airbag manufacturer, and fitting a lens into a rocket.
